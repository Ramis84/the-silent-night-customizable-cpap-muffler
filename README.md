# The "Silent Night" Customizable CPAP Muffler
This CPAP muffler/silencer can be used to dramatically reduce the noise travelling up the hose to the mask.

**NOTE:** This is compatible with standard rubber hose connectors (default 22mm, but it is customizable). If using the Resmed Airmini, or other travel CPAPs with non-standard hose connectors, an adapter will need to be used.

## Introduction
While using my travel CPAP (a Breas Z1 Auto) for treating my sleep apnea, the noise travelling up the hose have been bothering me. I have tested a couple of mufflers on the market, like the Breas Q-Tube and Breas Q-Lite, but have not been satisfied with the sound reduction, so I have been requiring ear-plugs. This design is fully customizable, but I have included 3 sizes which will be enough for most people, small (70mm long, small volume), medium (85mm, bigger volume) and large (100 mm, very big volume). I recommend the large variant for most people, but even the small design is quieter than the Breas Q-Tube/Q-Lite, so feel free to try them all out. Using these designs, I no longer have a need for ear plugs!

I designed this sound absorption muffler/silencer to be easy to print and assemble, and use common materials. The muffler consists of 3 printed parts: An outer cylinder body, end cap (female or male, depending on if you want the muffler attached directly on the CPAP), and inner mesh tube.

## Required materials

### 1. Sound absorption material
You will need to add a sound absorption material sheet. Since this will come in contact with the air you breathe, avoid fabrics that lint and release small fibres, like cotton or fleece. Prefer materials like nonwoven polyester (PET) or polypropylene filter media, sheets like the ones that are used normally as air intake filters in CPAPs, those are made to not shed any material, so will be quite safe to use. You can look for universal filters for air conditioners or vents, those are sold in sheets you can cut. Please note that the purpose of this material is not to filter the air, it is just to absorb the vibrations travelling upp the tube. The air to the mask is supposed to travel through the inner tube without any obstructions.

### 2. O-rings
You will need an O-ring between the body and end-cap, to make it air-tight. If using the female end cap, you will need to add an extra O-ring.

These are the sizes used by each part, which are very common in O-ring kits:

| Version | O-ring size |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Small body | 44 x 3.5 mm |
| Medium body | 47 x 3.5 mm |
| Large body | 50 x 3.5 mm |
| Female end-cap (optional) | 21 x 2.0 mm *or* 21 x 2.5 mm |

The large O-ring for the body can also be printed using a flexible material like TPU. Printing an O-ring for the female end-cap is difficult since it requires pretty tight tolerances, but not impossible

### 3. Small hose for male end-cap (optional)
If you use the male end-cap, you will need a small hose in-between the CPAP and muffler, with standard rubber 22mm connectors.

## Assembly instructions:
After printing, make sure to test that the muffler parts are completely air-tight before final assembly. Cover one end and blow hard into the other, and ensure that no air escapes any gap.

1. If using the female end cap, insert the 21 x 2.0 mm *or* 21 x 2.5 mm O-ring (depending on which version of the model you printed) into the slot on the inside of the connector.
2. Cut a sound absorption sheet into a long strip, slightly less wide than the inner tube.
3. Roll up the sound absorption sheet around the inner tube, so it forms a thick padding around the tube.
4. Insert the tube and absorption material together into the cylinder body. If it is too large, cut and reduce the length of the sheet.
5. Insert the large O-ring onto the end-cap
6. Screw in the end-cap into the cylinder.
7. Test that the muffler is completely air-tight after assembly.

## Maintenance
In between uses, I recommend disassembling the muffler to prevent any mold. And just to be safe, discard and replace the fabric regularly, like you do with the air intake filter on the CPAP.

## Dependencies
The project (v2, subfolder: [v2-build123d](v2-build123d)) is written using [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), and [bd_warehouse](https://bd-warehouse.readthedocs.io/) is used to implement ISO Standard Threads. The parametric source file [The Silent Night Customizable CPAP Silencer-Muffler v2.py](v2-build123d/The%20Silent%20Night%20Customizable%20CPAP%20Silencer-Muffler%20v2.py) generates and exports all STL and STEP files when executed.

The original version (v1) was originally written in OpenSCAD. These obsoleted legacy files are still available in the subfolder [v1-openscad](v1-openscad) for archival reasons.
